What is this scale?
[Ab  Bb  C  D   E   F  G Ab]
[  W   W   W  W   H  W  H  ]

Ab Major Scale
[Ab  Bb  C  Db  Eb  F  G Ab]
[  W,  W,  H,  W, W, W, H  ]

It's major because the third is unaltered. But we also have a #4 and #5.

The Lydian mode is a #4. What's a #5?

Is it a Ab Lydian augmented scale?
