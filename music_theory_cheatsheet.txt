Q: What is a scale? 
A: A set of notes.


MAJOR SCALES: 

[C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C]--note names
[D E F# G A B C# D]--D Major Scale
[  W, W, H, W, W, W, H ]--whole and half-steps
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]--degrees of the scale


MINOR SCALES:

Minor scales can be built from a Major Scale.

Natural Minor
[C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C]--note names
[1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7, 1]--degrees of the scale
[b3, b6, b7]--flat the third, sixth, and seventh of Major Scale

Harmonic Minor
[C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B, C]--note names
[1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, 7, 1]--degrees of the scale
[b3, b6]--flat the third and the sixth of the Major Scale

Melodic Minor
[C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B, C]--note names
[1, 2, b3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]--degrees of the scale
[D E F G A B C# D]--D melodic minor
[b3]--flat the third of the Major Scale



MODES:

Modes are simply scales starting on a different degree of a parent scale. 

MODES OF THE C MAJOR SCALE: (note: you could apply these modes to ANY major scale)

Ionian/Major Scale: [C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C]--C Ionian

Dorian: [D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D]--D Dorian
[b3, b7]

[E F# G A B C# D E]--E Dorian
[E F# G# A B C# D# E]--E Major

Phrygian: [E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E]
[b2, b3, b6, b7]

Lydian: F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F
[#4]

Mixolydian: G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G
[b7]

Aeolian(Natural Minor): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A
[b3, b6, b7]

Locrian: B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B
[b2, b3, b5, b6, b7]

MODES OF THE MELODIC MINOR

Let's build these together:

i melodic minor 
[C D Eb F G A B C]--C Melodic Minor


II Dorian ♭2, or Phrygian ♮6
[D Eb F G A B C D]--D Dorian b2  or the 2nd mode of the C Melodic Minor scale
[D E F# G A B C# D]--D major scale

III Lydian augmented
[Eb F G A B C D Eb]-- Eb Lydian Augmented, or the 3rd mode of the C Melodic Minor Scale

[Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb]--Eb major scale

You build the rest:

IV Lydian dominant
V Mixolydian ♭6
vi Locrian ♮2, or Half-diminished

VII Super Locrian, or altered scale
[B C D Eb F G A B]--B altered, or B Super Locrian
[B C# D# E F# G# A# B]--B Major Scale

Octatonic/Symmetric Diminished Scales:

half-whole
[C, Db, Eb, E, F#, G, A, Bb, C]
[  H,  W,  H, W,  H, W, H,  W ]


whole-half
[C, D, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, A, B, C]
[  W, H,  W, H,  W,  H, W, H ]


BUILDING CHORDS:

You can build triads by taking the [1st,3rd,5th] from a scale. (these are indexes, not the state of the degrees!)

For example:

D Major Scale--[D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D]
			   [1 ,2 ,3,  4, 5, 6, 7,  1]
D Major Triad--[D, F#, A]

You can build seventh chords by taking the [1st,3rd,5th,7th] from a scale. 

You can build whatever you want. 

Inversions are simply chords with the notes in a different order. 

Extensions(i.e. 9th, 11th, 13th) are referred to after a seventh is present in a chord.  

9th = 2nd
11th = 4th
13th = 6th



THE CONFUSION AROUND NAMING THE CHORDS:

1. A "major seven chord" means that the seventh of that chord's root's major scale is in it's unaltered or natural state. (meaning not flat) It is written like this Cmaj7, CMA7, and pronounced, "C major seven"

2. A "dominant chord" means that the seventh of that chord's root's major scale is flat. It is written like this: C7 and is pronounced "C seven"

3. A "minor seven" chord means that the third and seventh are flat: Cm7, C-7, Cmi7, "C minor seven"

4. An "augmented chord" means the fifth is sharp: C(#5), or C+

5. a "diminished triad" means the 3rd and 5th are flat. and is written Cdim.

6. A "half-dimished chord" is a seventh chord with a minor triad and a flat seven: Cm7(b5), pronounced "C half-diminished", or "C minor seven flat five"

7. A "fully dimished chord" is a seventh chord where the 3rd and 5th are flat, and the 7th is DOUBLE FLAT!, written with a little circle next to the Co7, (no slash through the circle, that's half-dimished) and is pronounced "C dimished seven", or "C fully diminished"  

8. All the above rules apply to extensions and alterations. (e.g. Cmaj9(#5) would be said "C major nine sharp 5") C13-- "C thirteen", but remember there is a b7(flat7 not B7) below that 13!

[F# G# A# B C# D# E# F#]--F# major scale

F#maj7
[F# A# C# E#]

F#7 
[F# A# C# E]

F#m7 
[F# A C# E]



CHORD ANALYSIS:

1. Look for a triad. Is it major or minor? Is the fifth altered in some way? 
2. What about the seventh? Has it been changed?
3. Look for additional notes. 
4. What is this chord? 

[C, E, G, Bb, D]--C9

[C, E, G, B, D]--Cmaj9 

[E G Bb D]
[E F# G# A B C# D# E]--Em7(b5)

[G Bb D E]--Gm6
[G A B C D E F# G]

[E G Bb D]-C9 (rootless voicing)

[G A B C D E F#]

JAZZ LINGO: 

"good ears"

"voicings"-- the way you choose to play the notes of a chord.

"let's play this in two flats"-- refers to the major/minor scale which has two flatted notes. Which one is that? 

"Diatonic"

"Chromatic"

"Pentatonic"

"Blues Scale"
