THE MAJOR SCALE

Creation of a major scale in Brainfuck-like terms: 

Think of the piano keyboard as an inifinite loop of ticker tape preloaded into brainfuck: 


'>': Move the tapehead to the right.
'.': Print value at that location.   


1. Start on any note, let's say "E".  

2. Our array so far: E_Major_Scale = [E]

3. To create a major scale: >>. >>. >. >>. >>. >>. >.   OR   W W H W W W H  
 
4. Our new array: E_Major_Scale = [E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E] (note: musical scale arrays start with 1)

5. What is E_Major_Scale[5]?

6. What about E_Major_Scale[7]? 

7. These are the "degrees of the major scale, and their values"

8. All scales can be constructed in relation to this first major scale. (Or with Brainfuck)




MINOR SCALE [transformational matrices] to apply to the major scale:  

function flat(){
	<. 
} 

function sharp(){
	>.
}


1. Natural Minor 

matrix to apply: [b3, b6, b7]

[E_Major_Scale[3].flat(), E_Major_Scale[6].flat(), E_Major_Scale[7].flat()]  
	



2. Harmonic Minor 
3. Melodic Minor 





LINGO CONFUSION: 

1. Forget classical music's name for chords, as they are insane. 

2.
